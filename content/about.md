**Colin Anthony** was born in Zimbabwe, but, in true “curse bless me now with your fierce tears” fashion, he was forced to grow up on a farm in the harsh beauty of the Northern Cape. 

He currently lives in Cape Town, where he found himself drawn to printmaking by the methodical, multi-step and highly process oriented nature of this art form, and because the art work can evolve, sometimes unexpectedly, at each stage of the process. 

He favours the intaglio process of hard ground etching, working in high detail on miniatures, although he is exploring larger formats, as well as relief printing methods. 

Colin finds inspiration in the complexity of our relationship and connection to nature, to ourselves and to others, and the cracks that run through these. 

He was introduced to printmaking by Cape Town artist, Cath Theron, following which he join the Intaglio studio, where he has received training from artists Michele Rolestone, Oliver Hambsch and notably, Judy Woodborne.
